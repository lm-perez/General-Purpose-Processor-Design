# General-Purpose-Processor-Design
The objective is to design and construct an Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) in VHDL and implement it on an FPGA board to display desired outputs on various seven segment displays. The ALU in this lab consists of two registers, a control unit made with a finite state machine and a decoder, and an ALU core containing various operations and several seven segment displays. The register will serve as temporary storage units; it controls access to data values throughout the processing unit. The control unit houses a finite state machine and a 4-to-16 decoder that, depending on the state of the FSM, determines the operation of the ALU; which microcode is sent to the ALU. The finite state machine decides the sequence in which operations are run in the ALU. The 4-to-16 decoder is tasked with receiving the current state signal from FSM and decoding it to the operation-selector microcode. The ALU core contains various operations and the outputs from the ALU core will be displayed in different seven segment displays. The first ALU core will display the outputs from Table 1 and their corresponding student ID output. The second ALU core will display the outputs from Table 2 and their corresponding student ID output. Finally, the third display will output to another seven segment display and its corresponding student ID number depending on the given conditions.
